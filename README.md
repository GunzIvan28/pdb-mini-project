# Msc. Bioinformatics Miniproject 2024 - PDB Analysis Software (Protein Database Analysis Software)
To do this work, the students are expected to tap into their extensive knowledge of molecular biology, python programming and protein-protein interractions. Also the students should consult the [PDB Database](https://www.rcsb.org/) to enrich their structural proteomics knowledge. More details of the overall program functionality can be found in the [Project instructions directory](https://github.com/GunzIvan28/shared-mini-project/blob/master/Project-instructions/Masters_Python_Project%20_2024_PDB%20Analysis%20Interface.pdf).


The PDB Analysis Interface Mini-project aims to develop a user-friendly program allowing users to analyze Protein Data Bank (PDB) files efficiently. The program offers various options, including reading in PDB files, searching for glycosylation sites within proteins, and writing out coordinate files or sequences in different formats. Additionally, it provides information retrieval functionalities, such as displaying coordinate sequences, SEQRES sequences, alignment sequences, and non-water ligands within proteins. Users can also align sequences from two PDB files and save the alignment to a designated file. With a focus on single-chain PDB files, the program offers bonus functionality for multiple-chain PDBs. Through clear user prompts and comprehensive functionalities, this project aims to facilitate PDB analysis tasks effectively while ensuring user convenience and accuracy.

The deadline for submission is slated for 21st/May/2024 at 12:00HRS

All the best!
